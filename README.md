## Development

### Commits

TLDR: contributors can format commit messages in any way, maintainers should use conventional commits. 

This repository uses [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

Conventional commits are not enforced. General guidance:

- Commit messages can be formatted in any way on a pull request.
- Conventional commit messages are preferred on pull request squash and merge.

Run `npx cz` instead of `git commit` to lint commit messages using [@commitlint/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commitlint/cli).
